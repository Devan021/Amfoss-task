# Begin your Journey with Linux and Gith

**This  task was about to find location coordinates in google maps by storing values of certain files in directorys using terminal
   Basically this task's motive was to make the assignee learn basic  linux terminal and github commands so he could the following other tasks in the task list and    more, In my opinion this task was pretty usefull and whoever made this task i thank you from my bottom of my heart because of that person i was able to              understand how terminal commands work,The terminal git c commands i used for this tasked is uploaded in the SOLUTION.md file ..
