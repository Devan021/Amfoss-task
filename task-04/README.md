# Attempted
 
I Attemped this task ..this task was basically to desgin a program using data and id parameters tbh i only had a basic knowlegde what parameters where as i studied java during my 10 th but i forgot most of the stuff .. so it was hard for me to create a program and i  wanted to write  my own code so i kept refering to tutorials 
but i ended up getting nowwhere .. i learned some stuff but java wasnt something i could learn in a day or week ..i download api key from nasa website but i couldnt 
make a data and id parameter to collect the mars image from the website thus i couldnt complete this task.
