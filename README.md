## My experience through the tasks
  I havent done much tasks yet cause it was difficult for me do tasks along with academic assignments, but day by day i got adjusted through them ,
  Eventhough i wasnt able to complete much tasks i learnt a decent amount of stuff which my past self didnt know .. these tasks helped me devolop the 
  habit of self learning instead of getting spoon feeded like i did in high  school.
