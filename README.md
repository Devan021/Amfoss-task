## My experience through the tasks
  I couldnt do much of the tasks last year because of my lack of knowledge , I took a year off for learning various stuff and finally when 
  i came back to do these tasks it was an awesome feeling , the tasks which made me drink water looked easy as python to me and thanks to these amfoss       tasks i grew a lot (in my opinion ) in the last year
