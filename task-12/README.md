## Attempted

**I learnt how block chain works and how was bit coin mined through block chain from youtube there were lots of tutorials about it too 
 and in my tutorials people wrote their own block chain code and explained how sha126 worked in case of bitcode they also pinned their code in their
 description ..i really wanted to copy that code paste it in vscode and make a blockchain program but that wouldnt do me any good . i wont learn by 
 just plagirising . the block chain program was in javascript well u can do it any language u desire  but i m pretty weak with languages so instead of
 plagirising i thought of learning how to code block chain ,and i havent finished learning yet so the task remains unfinished unfortunately**
