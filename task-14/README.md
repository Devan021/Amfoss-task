# Bandit task
 *Basically the task was to use various linux commands like (cat,ls -alps,xargs,cd etc etc) to find the password hidden inside the given bandit file  and use the password to run each lvl .. to be honest i didnt know how to do it at first but i used  the youtube video [link](https://youtu.be/V0ncN90Nc9Q) for reference and did the task ...This task was medium hard for me as i had to figure out first how those commands worked ...but it was worth it as i learned some more commands today*
## Password
 *The password for each lvl is uploaded in .txt file*
