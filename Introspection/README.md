#Introspection

## Why must we chose you?
   
   During my early middle school i hated computers as a whole ...but during my high school my dad bought me a computer .. i used my next whole summer vacation infront of a monitor and cpu, All i did was play games and explore how such a computer works even though its made of microchips Thats what made me intersted in computers firstly, I studied ICSE stream during my 10th so i had to study java in cse , Well java seemed hard at first but it got easier ,easier and became fun as the games i used to play long before very soon ,The more i understood them more fun it became ,Unfortunately i had to choose biostream on my higher secondary ..but i still havent lost the love to codes and i see amfoss not just as a club but a learning medium for me to achieve what i can in my life through my love for coding

## Whats ur plan for 6 months?
  
   Once i applied to amfoss i got the email pinned with tasks i had to do for getting selected to amfoss ,to be honest i didnt understand a single thing what the tasks were ..flutter..Aeglomars..repo..git etcc those words were too complicated for my brain to process! But i couldnt just give up ,i came to amritapuri campus just to get into amfoss since such a great club it was ..i googled about tutorials and asked my seniors whenever i had a doubt  to understand as much i could and Well i did fail  some tasks but i were able to do most of them ,Though the satisfaction i got doing those tasks my own instead of plagarisng was really good ...I am looking forward to more tasks in future even though they are challenging ,well life without challanges is just like a  blank repository..i wanna progress my programming knowledge during the nxt 6 months and more months to come ..if i get selected to amfoss i m sure it ll help me a lot

## How would you contribute to the club?

   I will contribute the atmost of my abilties to the progress and prosperity of amfoss..even if i get to do a small part in the club i ll do the part as perfect as i could ..hopefully that becomes true

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

   As far as i know the selection process has been the same and had been continuing for the past few years and  the students who got selected were the pollen grains who made amfoss into a flower as now it is  especially my seniors ,their seniors and aluminis their contribution plays a important role and i can see that they want to give amfoss into hands of buds they select through the process to make amfoss more better in future , In my opinion the selection process is pretty good as it checks the progress of each student based on the similar task they are given ,this helps a student grow a lot even within limited amount of time
