# Creating a personal website

 ** This task was fun but it took me some time to do it ,but the task is not that hard as it seems**
  
 ## Road to My First Personal Website
 
 **Step 1: I went to (https://https://jekyllthemes.io) and downloaded a personal website theme
   Step 2: Downloading the theme lead me to a jkyll repo in github i forked the repo into my account(Devan021),
   i have made the forked repo public so u can refer to it*
   Step 3: I Edited the config.yml file and added the title for my website ,header and rest of the matters
   Step 4: I Edited the index.md file to create a blogpost and renamed it to blog.md
   Step 5: Next my repo needed a index.md inorder to print my first page in my website so i created one index.md file
           and wrote the commands to display the title and matter
   Step 6: Now my website was completed**
