# Programming

### This task was again an easy one.I did this task in python and i tried some of the tasks in C as i have learned C from CS50 and also tried it in my IDE's ....but unfortunetly it wasnt working tbh, so i again switched back to python 
### I went through some of the python function and methods from google and also [Automate_the_boring_stuff](https://www.automatetheboringstuff.com) literally helped me a lot with that.
### I have only done 6Qs/10 ...I tried the rest but wasnt actually getting accepted and some of them literally ran out of the time .
