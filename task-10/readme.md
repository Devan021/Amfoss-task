# CS50

### I know about the programs conducted by harvard university in my 12th grade and also wanted to join these.But i thought of concentrating more in studies.
### CS50 videos and their IDE's are just amazing , and also a great way to learn things much better.I basically dont know C cause i aint from that backgorund cause i learned python which is ofc easier than C, but still didnt wanted to learn a new language,but after going through the videos , it changed my mind.Every videos were just amazing and made me learn and complete the whole C which was been taught.(pointers were the only thing which confused me a lot.)
- I learned the basics of C 
- Learned how to use them in the right situation.
- Learned to solve real world problems.
- Learned [Scratch](https://github.com/rakshith6404/amfoss-stage0/blob/main/task-10/week-0/Task-10(cs50).sb3) too....
- This also helped me solve the [5th task](https://github.com/rakshith6404/amfoss-stage0/tree/main/task-05).
