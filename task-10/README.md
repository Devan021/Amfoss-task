# Attempted

**i Went through the CS50 lectures but i didnt understand them in first go ,Those lectures were a hour long so i couldnt rewatch them again as my
online classes were going on , i know i m making up an excuse(as i know some people had done all 15 of their tasks even when they undergo the same online classes as me)
I am a newbie at programming and stuff so its hard for me to grasp things as fast they could .. thats one of the main reason i want to join amfoss .. to improve 
myself as a person and my programming knowledge**
